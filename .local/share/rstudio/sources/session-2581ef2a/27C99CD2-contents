## Introduction
During my formative years, my family and I lived in a suburb outside of 
Baltimore, Maryland. I had been told all my life that Baltimore is one of the 
most dangerous cities in America but had not done any further investigation. To
learn more, I decided to delve into crime data to learn more about the frequency
and type of crime that happens in Maryland.

## The Data
The 2020 National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), is a national 
database of all crimes reported to the police. The data is very expansive and
includes information about the offender, victim, types of crime, and other 
relevant data in the form of lookup tables and datasets. For the purpose of this
project, I have merged the offense, victim, and offender datasets as well as
related lookup tables. Information about offender/victim ethnicity, age, race,
sex, type of crime, location, and more is captured in this dataset.

## Preliminary Analysis

*See Figures 1 and 2
For both offender and victim age graphs it seems that there is a left skew. 
The mean age of offenders and victims was 29.8 and 35.7, respectively. 
The split in age leads me to believe that there may be difference in the type
of crime committed by young offenders (i.e. age < 30) vs. older offenders 
(age >= 30).

*See Figures 3 and 4
Interestingly, it seems that although the composition of offenders is 
overwhelmingly male, the composition of victims is approximately even between 
males and females. The types of crimes committed against men and women may also
be different.

*See Figure 5
The top three locations for crime to occur in Maryland are Residence/Home, 
Parking/Drop lot/Garage, and Highway/Road/Alley/Street/Sidewalk. This seems to 
follow given that Baltimore is an urban area. The nature of the second and third
highest locations for crime seem to point to violent crime (e.g. robbery, 
theft). I will explore this further in the following graphs.

*See Figure 6 and 7
After splitting the data between offenders younger and older than 40, we find 
very little difference in the types of crimes they commit. For both groups, 
simple assault, destruction of property, and theft of motor vehicles were the 
most common crimes. It seems that among those incident reported, the types of 
crime in Maryland in 2020 do not differ much.

*See Figures 8 and 9
The top three crimes committed against women were false pretenses, simple 
assault, and motor theft. For men, the top three crimes were destruction of 
property, motor theft, and simple assault. However, women had simple assault 
committed against them at nearly the same rate as men while men overwhemingly 
committed more crimes than women.

*See Figures 10, 11 and 12
Intuitively, the crime with the highest frequency was motor theft and 
destruction of property for all locations. The number of simple assaults (~7500)
was roughly the same for all locations although the highest number of reported 
crimes were at home.

## Conclusion
After some data exploration, we have arrived on two possible hypotheses that 
warrant further investigation. First, we found from descriptive data that women
may experience violent crime against them at higher rates than men. Since men
disproportionately commit more crime, women may be experience a disproportionate
amount of violence against them. Second, there may be more violent crime
committed proportionately on public roads and parks compared to houses. Further 
investigation into these hypotheses may help police concentrate their efforts on
this afflicted areas.
